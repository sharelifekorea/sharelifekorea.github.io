Yesterday, I was able to get things running with the all the nuts and bolts connected. 
Now I just have to start designing the whole site again.

What I have to do:

1. Learn more about Jekyll
2. Create a wireframe (I know this must come first before developing but I need a proof of concept that this works.
3. link instagram feed it works (juicer)
4. Youtube connect

The rest would be done next year in 2017.

end of log
